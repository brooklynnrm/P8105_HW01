## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for the first homework assignment in p8105 class: Data Science 1.

## Problem 1

```{r echo = FALSE}

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```

### Description of the Penguins Dataset

The penguins data set includes the variables:  *`r variable.names(penguins)`*. 
Penguins is a data frame with `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. 
The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)`

```{r cars}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = penguins$flipper_length_mm,
  y = penguins$bill_length_mm
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
